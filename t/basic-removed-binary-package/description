Regression test (seen with fbreader)

This is a regression test. The situation has been experienced with fbreader:
src:fbreader dropped one of its binary packages in sid (say bin:A) but the
other binary package bin:fbreader had a dependency on bin:A in testing only.
This led britney2 to think that fbreader could not be removed without increasing
the uninstallability count, which is false since the newer bin:fbreader dropped
its dependency on bin:A in sid.

This bug has been fixed in britney2.git:94071b16491e90d78605791a316141b58cc3c6fc
