Basic multiple architecture test

In this test only two architectures are considered, i386 and amd64.

Testing consists of 3 packages, one on both architectures and an
architecture dependent on each.  All 3 have a newer version in
unstable and the i386-only package has been ported to amd64, but
the reverse is not true.
