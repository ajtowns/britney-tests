Test to ensure that binNMUs from superseded sources are not considered

Given a source which provides two packages and different versions in
testing and unstable, binNMUs in unstable corresponding to the older
source version should not be considered as migration candidates.

For example:

testing
-------

source 1
bin 1 arch1
bin 1 arch2

unstable
--------

source 2
bin 2 arch1
bin 1+b1 arch2

The binary migration on arch2 should not be considered a candidate.
