Check that Britney can remove obsolete source packages

An obsolete source package is defined as a source package that no
longer has any binaries in testing.  Usually caused by another source
producing the binary packages with the same name (but higher version)
as the obsolete source.

This case distinguishes itself from the regular source removal in the
case where the "obsolete" source is still in testing.  In this case,
"obsolete" source will still be removed from testing.
