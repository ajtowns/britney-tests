Simple test that britney throws out old library binaries

Once old "smooth-updated" binaries are no longer in use, britney
should remove them.

This starts in the state of "basic-smooth-update"'s expected end
state, except the ood-pkg has been binnmu'ed.  Britney should migrate
ood-pkg to testing and (then) libtest1, which is no longer used.
