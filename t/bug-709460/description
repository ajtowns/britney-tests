Minimal test case for #709460

Observed during a run on release.d.o.  The situation:

  * llvm-3.2 used to produce llvm-3.2-doc/3.2-5 (arch:all)
    - source is in testing and sid
  * llvm-toolchain has taken over llvm-3.2-doc as 1:3.2repack-6
    - the binary is still arch:all
    - source is only in sid
    - source is currently not built on all the architectures (that
      previously built llvm-3.2)
  * llvm-3.2 was binNMU'ed and the binNMU migrates during the run.

The first problem is that llvm-3.2-doc/1:3.2repack-6 ends up in
testing.  The second problem is that the binary ends up in testing
without it source package.  As Britney does "binary->source"-lookups
later, the absence of this source package causes a crash.
