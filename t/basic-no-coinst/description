This is a test case that tests the special feature of the transition tool that
comes with the coinst suite by Jérôme Vouillon at
darcs get http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~vouillon/coinst/darcs/dev/

Two binaries can be upgraded. Individually, everything is fine, but if both were upgraded, they would stop being uninstallable together.
