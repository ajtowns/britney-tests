Check that britney properly handles "X builts Y" and "Y builts X" case

Check that when a package Y is RC buggy, it does not affect the source
package unless said source package builts Y.

Currently, there is no "source" (or "binary") marker in the BugsV
files.  This makes it impossible to distinguish whether a given RC bug
affects the source packages X and or the binary X.  Britney currently
thinks this means that the bug applies to both packages.
