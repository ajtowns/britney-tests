Test that the auto-hinter does not migrate "too young" packages

In this test, a subset of the packages should migrate.  There is a
huge group of packages ready to migrate.  However, there is also a
large group of "young new" packages in sid that are related to this
group.

The group that is ready can migrate because the other packages are not
already in testing.  The auto-hinter should see this and only migrate
the packages that are "ready".
