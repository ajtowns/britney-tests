Check that Britney properly discovers "indirect" breakage

Check for breakage that is not present in direct relations of the
migrating package.  The case:

 right-1 depends on right-2 and right-2 depends on leaf.
 left-1 depends on left-2 and left-2 depends on migrating.
 provider provides right-1.

 to-be-broken and to-be-broken-all depends left-1 and right-1
 (versioned, so provider cannot supply it).

 not-broken depends on left-1 and right-1 (unversioned, so provider
 can supply it).

 migrating and leaf are co-installable in unstable, but the new
 version of migrating breaks this co-installability and therefore also
 to-be-broken and to-be-broken-all.
