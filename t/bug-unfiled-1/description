Unfiled bug caused by broken code - seen live

This was seen live 12th of July 2014 when trying to migrating
gnustep-back.

Basically, this test suite is "basic-smooth-updates" except it has one
more lib being smooth-updated (only to satisfy the dependency of the
another library being smooth-updated as well).


If your interested in the case, look for
MID:<E1X65ZF-0005Kt-F3@franck.debian.org> in the
britney@release.debian.org archives.
