Source packages takes the blame for RC bugs when binary is missing

This is a safe-guard to ensure that we do not rely on implementation
details of the Debian BTS.  Basically, if you have a source package
src:X that builds Y.  If someone files a bug against the binary
package X (which does not exist), the BTS seems to do the right thing
and have it affect src:X.

We are not actually sure that bug will be exported as affecting src:X
or just X.  But live-data suggests that such a bug will trigger the
latter case.  So we ensure that Britney blames source packages, if
there are no binaries to take the blame.
