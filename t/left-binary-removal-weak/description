Removal of left-over libraries from testing

The left-over libray can trivially be removed by migrating all
packages from unstable.

However, some implementations may fail to realise this and will refuse
to migrate "p" on the grounds that it breaks the left-over library.
In "left-binary-removal" the implementation will be stuck there.

This test allows implementations to migrate "q" (or "q" + "p") together
to avoid breaking the left-over library.  Depending on the way the
implementation works, this may take more than one iteration (thus it
will fail if "--fixed-point" is not used).
