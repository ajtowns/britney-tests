Test that the auto-hinter does not break testing

In this test, nothing should migrate.  There is a huge group of
packages ready to migrate, but if they did, they would break a lot of
packages already in testing.  If all packages from unstable were to
migrate together there would not be an issue, but not all of them are
ready to migrate (too young).
