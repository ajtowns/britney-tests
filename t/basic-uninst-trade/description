Case where Britney is allowed to migrate broken packages

Britney is allowed to migrate a source package as long as it is a
valid candidate and the overall installability is as good as it was
before.

In this case, by migrating some-src Britney can trade a broken
test-bin2 (in testing) for a broken some-bin2 (migrating).
