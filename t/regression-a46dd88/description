Regression: nuninst counters not always being updated during hints

This minor regression was introduced in commit a46dd88.

To trigger the bug, a hint had to do an uninstallability trade
(i.e. trade one uninstallable package for another) AND the original
uninstallability package had to be "fixed" by being removed from
testing.

The flaw could only be triggered via a hint (in the "non-recurse"
part), since "recurse" runs did not have this bug.
