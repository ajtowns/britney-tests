Check that Britney properly discovers "indirect" breakage

Check for breakage that is not present in direct relations of the
migrating package.  The case:

 right-1 depends on right-2 and right-2 depends on right-leaf.
 left-1 depends on left-2 and left-2 depends on left-leaf.
 provider provides right-1.

 to-be-broken and to-be-broken-all depends left-1 and right-1
 (unversioned, so provider can provide it).


Now, attempt to remove "provider" - this should break
to-be-broken{,-all}.
