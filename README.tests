Writing test cases
==================

A minimal test case consists of the following files:

 * <testset>/<test>/var/data/{unstable,testing}/{Sources,Packages_$arch}
   - Absent files will be created as empty files
   - $arch defaults to i386 (configurable in the test-data file)
 * <testset>/<test>/hints/test-hints
   - Hint file for the test.
   - If absent, it will be created as an empty file.
 * <testset>/<test>/expected
   - format documented below.
 
There are a number of optional files that may also be useful:

  * <testset>/<test>/test-data
    - Change parameters, architectures etc.  See below.
  * <testset>/<test>/description
    - Used to document the purpose of the test.
  * <testset>/<tests>/hooks/post-setup
    - Script called after the test rundir has been created and the
      files have been copied over.
    - Can generate any of the files needed for the test except
      test-data.
  * <testset>/<tests>/var/data/$suite/BugsV
    - List of RC bugs affecting a given package.
    - Empty file is created if absent.
  * <testset>/<test>/var/data/testing/{Urgency,Dates}
    - Files containing urgency and upload dates for packages.
    - Will be auto-generated if absent.  Also see the "Test-urgency.in"
      file below.
  * <testset>/<tests>/var/data/{testing-,}proposed-updates/{Sources,Packages_$arch}
    - The testing-proposed-updates files will be automatically generated as
      empty files if not present.
    - The proposed-updates files will merely be absent if not created by hand.

The "expected" file
-------------------

The test must have a file called "expected" that shows the expected
result.  It consists of zero or more lines of:

 <name> <version> <arch-or-source>[ <section>]

<name> is the name of the package, <version> is the version of the
package and <arch-or-source> is the architecture of the package (for
binary packages) or the word "source" (for source packages, without
quotes).  Basically it is a HeidiResult file except the section.

Note: It is permissible to include the section in the expected file,
but they are ignored.  This means it is possible to use a HeidiResult
file from a Britney run as an "expected" file.

This file should be stored as "<testset>/<test>/expected".

The "test-data" file
--------------------

The "test-data" can be used to configure various aspects of the test
and is used to generate the resulting britney.conf file.

The syntax of the "test-data" file is the same syntax as used by
the Debian Control files (Policy ยง5.1).  Unless otherwise started
all fields are "simple" (i.e. restricted to a single line).

The following fields are available:

 * Architectures
   - space separated list of architectures enabled in this test.
   - defaults to: i386
   - Used to generate the britney.conf file
   - NB: This is used to auto-generate empty Packages_$arch files.
 * No-Break-Architectures
   - space separated list of "NOBREAKALL" architectures enabled in this test.
   - Used to generate the britney.conf file
   - defaults to: i386
 * Fucked-Architectures
   - space separated list of "FUCKED_ARCHES" architectures enabled in this test.
   - Used to generate the britney.conf file
   - defaults to: <empty>
 * Break-Architectures
   - space separated list of "BREAK_ARCHES" architectures enabled in this test.
   - Used to generate the britney.conf file
   - defaults to: <empty>

The "Test-urgency.in" file
--------------------------

If a test does not provide an "Urgency" or a "Dates" file, the test
runner will auto-generate them using "urgency low" and "uploaded in
1970 Jan" as date for all packages in sid.  The "Test-urgency.in" file
can be used to override these values on a per package level.

It consists of 0 or more lines in the following format:

 <source>/<version> <date-spec> <urgency>

<source> is the name of the source package and <version> is the
version of the package to be affected.  <urgency> must be a valid
urgency (i.e. one of low, medium, high, critical or emergency).
<date-spec> can be either an * or age=<days>, where <days> is a
positive.

If <date-spec> is *, then the default date is used.  Otherwise, <days>
describes how "old" the package (i.e. how many days ago it was
"uploaded").

The <source>/<version> pair must appear in the Sources file for
unstable.

Caveat: The test runner has to generate an absolute date.  This
creates a race condition between the generation of the Dates file and
Britney is started.
  Therefore, always ensure the test works even if the age is one
higher than written in the test.  (E.g. use age=3 rather than age=4
with urgency medium).  Otherwise the test may happen to fail if run
too close to the start of (Britney's) day.

This file should be stored as "<testset>/<test>/var/data/testing/Test-urgency.in".

The "post-setup" hook
---------------------

The "post-setup" hook should be an executable script.  It will called with
the path to the rundir of the test it is in.  When it is called, all files
have been copied over and auto-generatable files will have been generated
(including the britney.conf file).

It may create/modify/delete any file except "test-data"[1] as it pleases,
including (but not limited to) the "expected" file.

The hook must exit 0 or the test will abort.

[1] It can modify "test-data", but the test-runner will not reload it so it
will merely create undesired results.
