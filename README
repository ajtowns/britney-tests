The britney test suite
======================

This is the test suite for the Debian Testing Migration Tool, britney.

To run this, you will need:
 * britney (or a clone thereof)
   - including its dependencies :)
 * perl
   - Class::Accessor (libclass-accessor-perl)

Running a test
--------------

To run a test, use:

 $ bin/run-single-test <britney> <testset> <rundir> <test>

where

 - <britney> is the path to the britney executable.
   - It will be passed "-c <conf> --control-files -v"
 - <testset> is the testset (the t/ dir should do)
 - <rundir> is where the runtime data is dumped
   - this must not exists when running the command above
 - <test> is the name of the test.

Example:

 $ bin/run-single-test britney2/britney.py t test-out basic

The return code is 0 on success and 1 on error.

Advanced topics
===============

Expected input for britney
--------------------------

 * britney.conf
   - Will be generated (see perl-lib/BritneyTest::_gen_britney_conf)
 * {testing,testing-proposed-updates,unstable}/Sources
 * {testing,testing-proposed-updates,unstable}/BugsV
 * {testing,testing-proposed-updates,unstable}/Hints/*
 * {testing,testing-proposed-updates,unstable}/Packages_$arch
   - one for each architecture
 * FauxPackages
 * testing/Dates
 * testing/Urgency
   

Expected output from britney
----------------------------

 * HEIDI_OUTPUT
   - specified in the britney.conf

Currently only the Heidi output is compared to the "expected" result.

Writing a test
--------------

No support yet, so all data files must be created manually
(i.e. copy-waste from the "basic" test).

The test must have a file called "expected" that shows the expected
result.  It consists of zero or more lines of:

 <name> <version> <arch-or-source>

<name> is the name of the package, <version> is the version of the
package and <arch-or-source> is the architecture of the package (for
binary packages) or the word "source" (for source packages, without
quotes).  Basically it is a Heidi file except the section.

This file should be stored as "<testset>/<test>/expected".
